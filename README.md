# HousePriceMLM
https://housepricemlm.streamlit.app/

This project is a Streamlit-based web application using machine learning models to predict house prices. It allows users to select different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest), input house features, and visualize the importance of each feature in predicting prices.

ðŸš€ Features
 - Machine Learning Models: Supports Linear Regression and Random Forest models for predictions.
 - Interactive Inputs: Users can enter house details like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to get price predictions.
 - Feature Importance Visualization: Provides insights into how each feature impacts the prediction.
 - Model Selection: Compare performance across different models.
 - User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for simplicity and accessibility.
